# The Struggle in adding this file
Seriously, I had been ChatGPTying and thinking and coding to find out "Why my files of html and css are not getting added into my GitHub Repo?!"
1. I found out that my files were not within the LocalRepo, they were outside it!
2. I learnt that `git branch` doesn't work until we commit a change in the repo.
Took a lot of time, but yes, I learnt something! ^__^
